# Data-Analysis-Online-Sales-Project
This project focuses on transforming raw sales data into a clean, analysis-ready dataset by handling missing values, standardizing formats, correcting inconsistencies, and creating calculated columns such as revenue and profit. The final dataset supports sales performance analysis, customer insights, and data-driven decision-making.
